## 📢 Official Repository for ICDE 2025 Paper (CCF-A)

This repository hosts the official codebase for our paper:

**“Approximate Vector Set Search: A Bio-Inspired Approach for High-Dimensional Spaces”**,
published at **ICDE 2025** (a CCF-A ranked conference).

🧬 **Overview:**
This project proposes a novel bio-inspired method for efficient approximate vector set search in high-dimensional spaces. The algorithm is motivated by biological selection and clustering mechanisms and is tailored for large-scale similarity search tasks in areas such as bioinformatics, machine learning, and data mining.
